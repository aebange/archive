How to copy files via SCP/PSCP with RPI/PC
--------------------------------------------


Objectives
	A) Copy a text file from a windows PC to a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B

	
Assumptions
	A) You have PuTTY installed on your windows based PC
	B) You have connected via SSH between the RPI and windows PC
	C) The RPI has SSH enabled in its config
	D) The RPI is powered ON and is connected to the internet
	E) You have a windows cmd prompt open on the windows PC.

Procedure for transferring files from PC to RPI
	A) Aquire initial file path
	B) Aquire destination file path
	C) Aquire RPI IP address
	D) Transfer file to RPI
	
	
Transferring files from PC to RPI
-------------------------
1. Aquire intiial file path


	A. Navigate console to current location of desired file for transfer
		a. Example file will be "commitTemplate.txt"
		b. Example file will be located in C:/Users/Kotevski/Desktop/Example/commitTemplate.txt
		c. dir command can be used to list directories
		d. cd command can be used to change/enter a directory
		e. To back out of a directory, type "cd .."
		f. Directories are case sensitive
	
		
2. Aquire destination file path


	A. Example file will be located in home/pi/Projects/Notes/commitTemplate.txt
		
		
3. Aquire IP for RPI


	A. Use the "sudo hostname" or "sudo ifconfig" commands via SSH to see the IP of the RPI on your network
	B. The IP will appear as a number containing 9-11 numbers, example: "192.168.1.105"
		
		
4. Transfer file to the RPI


	A. Start off the command using "pscp" (SCP) followed by the name of the initial file, the destinations IP address, and finally the filepath of the desired destination. 
		a. Reminder: This will only work if you are currently inside of the directory of the file you wish to transfer.
		b. Reminder: The PSCP command is NOT executed from the SSH client. Rather, you need a regular windows cmd prompt to SCP from windows to the RPI
		c. Example: "pscp commitTemplate.txt pi@192.168.1.105:/home/pi/Projects/Notes/commitTemplate
		d. Raspberry Pi's have a default password and user for SSH/SCP. The user is "pi" and the password is typically "raspberry" 
		e. Once completed, the SCP client will show the transfer progress until complete. It is very slow, SCP is only useful for small files usually containing just text
	B. Ensure that all spacing is correct or the PSCP client will see several remote sources and fail to operate properly.
